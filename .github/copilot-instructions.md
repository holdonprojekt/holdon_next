- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created. (Recreated after scaffolding.)

- [x] Clarify Project Requirements (User wants a modern Next.js + Tailwind refactor retaining original design.)

- [x] Scaffold the Project (Ran `npx create-next-app@latest . --ts --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir`.)

- [x] Customize the Project (Refactored layout to Tailwind components with localized routing.)

- [x] Install Required Extensions (No additional extensions requested.)

- [x] Compile the Project (pnpm build)

- [x] Create and Run Task (Added VS Code task to run `pnpm dev` in the workspace.)

- [x] Launch the Project (Started `pnpm dev` via VS Code task; running in standard mode.)

- [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete (Updated README and cleaned this checklist.)

Execution Guidelines
- Track progress through this checklist and update statuses as steps finish.
- Keep communication concise, avoid unnecessary command output, and only describe structure when asked.
- Use the project root as the working directory, avoid creating extra folders, and run commands with `.` when needed.
- Do not install extensions beyond those explicitly requested through project setup tools.

Project Content Rules
- Assume a Hello World baseline only when project details are missing.
- Skip adding non-requested media or integrations; label any placeholder assets clearly.
- Ensure generated components support the requested workflow and confirm assumptions before implementing features.

Task Completion Rules
- Project scaffolding and compilation succeed.
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `README.md` exist and reflect current work.
- User receives clear guidance to debug or launch the project.

General Workflow
- Work through each checklist item systematically.
- Keep communication focused and professional.
- Follow development best practices at all times.
